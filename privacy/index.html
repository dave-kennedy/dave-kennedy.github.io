<h1>Privacy</h1>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<p>This site doesn't use cookies and doesn't collect, process or store any PII.</p>
<p>However, this site is hosted on GitHub Pages, which has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a GitHub Pages site is visited, the visitor's IP address is logged and stored for security purposes, regardless of whether the visitor has signed into GitHub or not. For more information about GitHub's security practices, see GitHub Privacy Statement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Alternatives to big tech</h2>
<p>I don't get a dime for advertising any of this stuff. I just like it because I'm a nerd.</p>
<h3>Cloud file storage</h3>
<p>Instead of iCloud or OneDrive or Google Drive, try <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>. It's not perfect, but it's constantly improving and has a strong community. If you're nervous about self-hosting, check out <a href="https://nextcloud.com/providers/">any of these providers</a>.</p>
<h3>Cloud productivity software</h3>
<p>Instead of Google Docs or Microsoft Word, check out <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/">CryptPad</a>. In addition to collaborative document editing, it also has slides, sheets, etc. Plus you get a bit of file storage for free. <a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/">Collabora</a> is a similar product that can be integrated into your Nextcloud server, but I have yet to try it.</p>
<h3>Operating system</h3>
<p>Instead of Mac or Windows, try <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> or one of its flavors: <a href="https://kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a>, <a href="https://lubuntu.me/">Lubuntu</a> or <a href="https://xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a>, to name a few. It's easier to install and use than ever and free to boot.</p>
<h3>Phone</h3>
<p>Instead of an Android or iPhone, consider a <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/">Librem 5</a>. <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">PinePhone</a> is promising but is still too unstable to recommend to anyone that isn't an enthusiast for now.</p>
<p>If you already have an Android and want to de-Google it, try <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> or <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>. Full disclosure: the learning curve here can be a bit steep and there are lots of ways you can brick your device.</p>
<p>You might not need a &quot;smart&quot; phone at all. I'm happy with my &quot;dumb&quot; phone. The options here are limited but growing. Check out <a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/">Light Phone</a>, <a href="https://mudita.com/">Mudita Pure</a> and <a href="https://sunbeamwireless.com/">Sunbeam F1</a> for starters. <a href="https://dumbphones.pory.app/">Dumbphone Finder</a> has lots more.</p>
<h3>Everything else</h3>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">Privacy Tools</a> for more recommendations. And, while I can't vouch for either of them, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/">r/privacy</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyGuides/">r/PrivacyGuides</a> are available for newbies with questions.</p>
