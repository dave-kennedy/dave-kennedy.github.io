        <h2>text-align</h2>

        <p>
            This property only applies to a container's content. It has no
            effect on void elements. To center a void element, wrap it in a
            <code>div</code> element, then change the parent's
            <code>text-align</code> property to <code>center</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>left (default)</h3>

            Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of
            five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court,
            compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through
            the defender's hoop, while preventing the opposing team from
            shooting through their own hoop.
        </div>

        <div style="text-align: center;">

        <h2>float</h2>

        <p>
            This property pulls an element out of its default position to the
            left or right, allowing other content to "wrap around" it until
            it's "cleared" by another element with a <code>clear</code>
            property set to <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, or
            <code>both</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>left</h3>

        <img src="basketball.jpg" style="float: left;" />

        <p>
            This is a paragraph. Its top-left corner aligns with the top-right
            corner of the image. When its content fills the available
            horizontal space, it wraps to a new line, leaving enough room for
            the image to fit on the left. In other words, it "wraps around" the
            image.
        </p>

        <p>This text also wraps around the image.</p>

        <p style="clear: left;">
            This text does not wrap around the image because it "clears the float."
        </p>

        <h3>right</h3>
