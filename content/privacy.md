## Alternatives to big tech

I don't get a dime for advertising any of this stuff. I just like it because I'm a nerd.

### Cloud file storage

Instead of iCloud or OneDrive or Google Drive, try [Nextcloud][nextcloud]. It's not perfect, but it's constantly improving and has a strong community. If you're nervous about self-hosting, check out [any of these providers][nextcloud-providers].

### Cloud productivity software

Instead of Google Docs or Microsoft Word, check out [CryptPad][cryptpad]. In addition to collaborative document editing, it also has slides, sheets, etc. Plus you get a bit of file storage for free. [Collabora][collabora] is a similar product that can be integrated into your Nextcloud server, but I have yet to try it.

### Operating system

Instead of Mac or Windows, try [Ubuntu][ubuntu] or one of its flavors: [Kubuntu][kubuntu], [Lubuntu][lubuntu] or [Xubuntu][xubuntu], to name a few. It's easier to install and use than ever and free to boot.

### Phone

Instead of an Android or iPhone, consider a [Librem 5][librem]. [PinePhone][pinephone] is promising but is still too unstable to recommend to anyone that isn't an enthusiast for now.

If you already have an Android and want to de-Google it, try [GrapheneOS][grapheneos] or [LineageOS][lineageos]. Full disclosure: the learning curve here can be a bit steep and there are lots of ways you can brick your device.

You might not need a "smart" phone at all. I'm happy with my "dumb" phone. The options here are limited but growing. Check out [Light Phone][light-phone], [Mudita Pure][mudita] and [Sunbeam F1][sunbeam] for starters. [Dumbphone Finder][dumbphone-finder] has lots more.

### Everything else

Go to [Privacy Tools][privacy-tools] for more recommendations. And, while I can't vouch for either of them, [r/privacy][r-privacy] and [r/PrivacyGuides][r-privacyguides] are available for newbies with questions.
