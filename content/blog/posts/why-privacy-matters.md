I doubt I can cover this subject any better than John Oliver already has, especially in the latest episode of Last Week Tonight. This week's rant was [all about data brokers][1]. He said everything I would have said if I were a cheeky Brit with a sharp tongue and a top-notch writing team and, as always, managed to deliver tons of boring information with his signature wit that made it both hilarious and disturbing.

Of course, this isn't the first time he's talked about privacy. If you haven't already, you've gotta watch his gut-busting [interview with Edward Snowden][2].

Afterwards, consider ditching big tech like Apple, Google and Microsoft. It might seem like a monumental effort, but you can do it one step at a time. Don't know where to start? [I've got you][3].
