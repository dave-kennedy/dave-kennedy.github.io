  <p>I have a soft spot for that dry, sarcastic brand of humor that seems to come so naturally to Brits. And John Oliver is particularly good at it. But after one or two episodes of Last Week Tonight, I'm overcome with depression and hopelessness and have to stop and reconsider what I'm doing with my life before I go off the deep end and start a riot or petition for a shower head with optional pulp. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phieTCxQRLA">diatribe on the trucking industry</a> was both hilarious and shocking. It prompted me to do some of my own research, after which I'm ready to cancel my Amazon Prime subscription. (The streaming service was never that great anyways.)</p>
<p>Just in case you needed any more reasons to cancel Amazon Prime:</p>

<p>What upsets me the most is Jeff Bezos could afford to pay all of his employees a lot more, but apparently he has better things to do with his money. Then again, who wouldn't want to spend <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/tech/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-launch-scn/index.htmlhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/tech/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-launch-scn/index.html">11 minutes trapped in a little tin can in orbit</a>?</p>
